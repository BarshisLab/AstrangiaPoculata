# Info on creating Figure S5
-Raw data is included in RedChannelIntensity_data.csv. Average red channel intensity values were created using the scripts published by Winters et al. (2009), the two Matlab .m files needed to complete these analyses (CalibrateImageA031108.m and AnalyzeIntensity071108.m) are also included in this folder. 

-Average red channel intensity data was analyzed and plotted using the FigS5_RGB_analysis.R script included in this folder. 

-The full protocol for analyzing this data can be found in this repository at https://github.com/BarshisLab/AstrangiaPoculata-Thermal-Performance/tree/master/Protocols

-Note: In order to use the scripts from Winters et al. (2009) to calculate a chlorophyll/symbiont density proxy, all coral photos have to have a gray scale, such as the one found at the website below, included in the photo.
