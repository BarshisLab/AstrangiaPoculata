# Info on creating Figure S1 
-Plots temperature recorded by hobo loggers over all 16 of the thermal ramp experiments by group (heat holobiont, cold holobiont, heat skeleton and cold skeleton)

-First, use hobocleaner.py script to clean the raw hobo logger files and trim the files to only include the times during which an experiment was being run

-Next, organize all cleaned.txt files by type of ramp experiment

-Now, can use the .R script to plot all temperature data by category of ramp.
